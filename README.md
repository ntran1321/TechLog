Learning new technologies can be overwhelming for software developers. This web application was created so that coders can easily track the languages and technologies they learn and add specific topics for each log. Each topic can be given a comprehension score from 0-4 and the total score for each corresponding technology is viewed on the homepage. The fully interactive learning log can be continuously updated and technologies/topics can be added and deleted.

Technologies used:

Java, Spring MVC, Gradle, JUnit Testing, JPA, Hibernate, JSP

JavaScript, HTML/CSS, JSON, JQuery, AJAX, REST

Features that I would like to add in the future are user logins and generalize the application so that any user can log new knowledge not specific to programming technologies.
